			       OVERVIEW
		 
Blind Jump  is a  simple procedurally  generated space  adventure game
that I've been working on for fun  in my free time.  The object of the
game is  to get  to the  teleporter at  the end  of each  level, while
battling monsters  and evil robots. Check  out this clip to  see it in
action: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcKT4W-T3KA

This was my first real programming project, some of the  code is good,
while some  of it is  sloppy. Maybe  you can learn  something from  it
though :) Have fun!

NOTE: I no longer work on this repository. I ended up developing the 
game for Gameboy Advance instead, see the finished version here:
